I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE), [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore. My current research interests include optimization theory, cyber-physical systems, machine vision, and deep reinforcement learning applied in Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV).

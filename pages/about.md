I received the B.E. degree in aircraft design and engineering from Beihang University, China, in 2014, and the M.S. degree in flight dynamics and control from Beihang University, in 2017. From 2017 to 2020, I was a software engineer in the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ISCAS), Beijing, China. 

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. My research interests include optimization theory, cyber-physical systems, robotics and computer vision.
